        <h1>Life’s Journey!</h1>

        <p>
            I’m currently a <strong>Software Engineering student</strong> in my <strong>4th semester</strong> at 
            <strong>Islamia College Peshawar</strong>. I am passionate about coding, technology, and learning new skills in web development, app development, and AI.

            This blog is part of my professional development journey and our academic project using GitHub Pages. 
            Through this platform, I'm exploring how to create and deploy websites, manage code repositories, and build a digital portfolio.
        </p>

        <p>
            My goal is to improve my skills, work on real-world tech projects, and contribute to the open-source community. 
            I’m excited about the endless possibilities in software engineering and the impact technology can make today.
